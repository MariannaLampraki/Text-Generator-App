# Text-Generator-App
This project is part of my lessons at EKEK Athena online Python Courses

The program is supposed to read a couple of files and then store some statistics about the words. Then, the user inputs a word and a number. The program should display some words that are likely to follow the inserted word.

##### DISCLAIMER: I do not own the sample text files. I am using them solely for testing purposes.
